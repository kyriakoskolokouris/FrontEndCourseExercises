            <td>Numbers are without surprise representing numeric values AKA numbers.
                In JavaScript it is used the 64-bit format.
                However, it is worthy to be noted that there are three special values in JavaScript that are considered numbers but donâ€™t behave like normal numbers.
                These are: <ol>
                    <li>Infinity</li>
                    <li>Infinity (Negative)</li>
                    <li>NaN</li>
                </ol>

        <tr>
            <td class="type">2. String</td>
            <td>A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="type">3. Boolean</td>
            <td> Boolean is a logical data type that can have only the values true or false. For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in if statements) or repeat (such as in for loops).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="type">4. Undefined</td>
            <td>It is an empty value, which usually is assigned automatically  to variables that have just been declared.</td>
        </tr>
